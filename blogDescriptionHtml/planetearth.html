            Planet Earth is a 2006 British television series produced by the
         BBC Natural History Unit. Five years in the making, it was the most 
         expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC and 
         also the first to be filmed in high definition.The series received
         multiple awards, including four Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and an 
         award from the Royal Television Society.Planet Earth premiered on
         5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and by June 2007 had 
         been shown in 130 countries. The original version was narrated by David 
         Attenborough, whilst some international versions used alternative narrators.
         The series has eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview 
         of a different biome or habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute 
         episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the
         challenges of filming the series.

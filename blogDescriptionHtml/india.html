        <h2>INDIA:The Golden Bird</h2>
        <p>
            Ancient India (from 3000 BCE to around 10th century AD) is the period when
            India was known as <b>The Golden Sparrow</b>. This era witnessed many
            popular dynasties like <b>Maurya, Shunga, Kushan, Gupta,</b> etc. This era
            witnessed cultural confluences and economic booms at many junctures yet the
            fabric of traditions never got destroyed. Even today people say :<h3>‘Jaha Daal
            Daal par sone ki chidiya karti hai basera wo bharat desh hai mera’</h3> 
        <p>  
            (India is a country where the golden sparrow dwells on every branch of a tree.)
            <br> <br>
            Here are some parameters that highlight the fact that Ancient India was the
            golden bird:

            <h2>Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
            In ancient India, there were complicated subjects like metaphysics and
            philosophy explored in great details. Along with these subjects like Ayurveda,
            Public Administration, and Economics that flourished in Bharatvarsha. The
            different treatises like Arthashastra and Smritis that stand as the proofs for
            this. Knowledge was considered to be wealth and there were universities like
            Nalanda, Taxila, Vallabhi which were renowned worldwide.
            Many foreign scholars came here to study and gain the unique knowledge passed
            down from generation to the next. The Gurukul system imparted knowledge which
            had to practice in day-to-day life rather than Macaulay’s rote learning system
            that we follow today.

            <h2>Economy</h2>

        <p>
            The biggest factor that made India the golden bird in the eyes of other countries is also the plethora of
            wealth that this land possessed. The Kushana and Gupta period deserve a special mention as there were gold
            coins issued. The currency and numismatics during the period are widely known for their efficiency and
            perfection. Agriculture, industries, and trade were given equal importance and all formed the part of the
            economy in the science called ‘Vaarta’. There was no absolute poverty and unemployment in this age. This is
            also because right earning also formed the part of Purusharthas- Artha i.e. wealth.

            <h2>Art and Architecture</h2>
        <p>   
            From simple Stupas to magnificent temples, the architecture of Ancient India has stood the test of time and
            even today people are amazed by the excellence of the craftsmanship. The beginning of art and architecture
            can be seen at the Pre-historic paintings of Bhimbetka and the zenith of this would be the Chaul temples in
            Tamil Nadu.
        </p> 

            <h2>Polity and Administration</h2>
        <p>
            Politics in India today is infested with corruption and nepotism. There is no denial of the fact that
            monarchy existed in Ancient India. But the most important point is that there were decentralization and
            division of labor as well. Welfare existed as a governing principle. The science of Public Administration
            held in regard to the concept of justice and human rights.

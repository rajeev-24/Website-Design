            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
            acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified
            in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since
            spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. As of 7 May 2020, 
            more than 3.75 million cases have been reported across 187 countries and 
            territories, resulting in more than 263,000 deaths. More than 1.24 million 
            people have recovered.
            Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss 
            of smell and taste. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, 
            some progress to viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, or cytokine storm. 
            The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days 
            but may range from two to fourteen days.The virus is primarily spread between
            people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing,
            sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces 
            rather than remaining in the air over long distances. People may also become 
            infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. 
            On surfaces, the amount of virus declines over time until it is insufficient 
            to remain infectious, but it may be detected for hours or days. It is most 
            contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although 
            spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. 
            The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase 
            chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be
            helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection 
            based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using it 
            for routine screening.
            Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, 
            maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), 
            quarantine, covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. In 
            addition, the use of a face covering is recommended for those who suspect they 
            have the virus and their caregivers. Recommendations for face covering use
            by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending, some recommending 
            against, and others requiring their use. There is limited evidence for 
            or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider 
            community.
            According to the World Health Organization, there are no available vaccines nor 
            specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19. On 1 May 2020, the United States 
            gave Emergency Use Authorization to the antiviral remdesivir for people hospitalized
            with severe COVID-19. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care,
            isolation, and experimental measures. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
            declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
            (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.Local transmission of the
            disease has occurred in most countries across all six WHO regions.

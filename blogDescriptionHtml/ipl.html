            The 2020 Indian Premier League, also known as IPL 13 and officially known as
            Vivo IPL, was scheduled to be the thirteenth season of the IPL, a professional
            Twenty20 cricket league established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
            (BCCI) in 2007.
            The tournament was scheduled to commence on 29 March 2020. However, it was
            suspended until 15 April due to the global coronavirus pandemic. On 9 April,
            a BCCI official told CNBC TV18 that the Board was considering hosting the
            tournament in July or during the winter, possibly behind closed doors. On 14
            April 2020, Narendra Modi said that the lockdown in India would last until at
            least 3 May 2020, with the tournament postponed further. The following day,
            the BCCI suspended the tournament indefinitely due to the pandemic.

            The BCCI released the fixture details on 18 February 2020. The league stage
            was scheduled to start on 29 March 2020, with the opening match between Mumbai
            Indians and Chennai Super Kings, the finalists of the previous season, at
            Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. However, due to the ongoing coronavirus
            pandemic, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced on 12 March that
            IPL matches can be held in the state only if they are played in empty stadiums.
            Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia declared that no IPL match will be
            held in Delhi.
            On 13 March, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) suspended the
            tournament until 15 April, in view of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The
            decision regarding the postponement was reached by the Governing Council after
            a meeting with the owners of all eight franchise teams. On 17 April, Sri
            Lanka Cricket offered to host the tournament.
